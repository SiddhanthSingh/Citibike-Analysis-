# Citibike-Analysis-

The code in this repository aims to analyze the citibike ride sharing progam files from their website. Here the files are first binded into a common .csv file.
Next, the rows and columns are read in order to form objects that can be read by the machine. At this stage we can also produce an output of the files in order to glean a combined file.
The analysis continues next, with the final step being a nodal analysis. There is also room to add a google maps feature in the next variants.

Hope you find this interesting!
